# Smart-Drainage-System
One of the important needs of keeping the city clean was a perfect drainage
system so each and every city has its own drainage system. We need to maintain
those systems perfectly, sometimes the manual monitoring is incompetent which
leads to the blockage and overflow of the drainage system. Due to lack of knowledge
the worker may meets to an accident as they have no idea how will be the condition
in those manholes. To overcome this situation, we proposed a smart drainage system
which will monitor the flow, chemical content and the blockage in the system.
